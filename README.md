### :man_technologist: About Me :

I studied Physics and earned an M.Sc. in Theoretical Chemistry from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp, Campinas-SP, Brazil). I am currently finishing my Ph.D. at the same university, focusing on molecular dynamics simulations of enzymes, specifically Glycosyl Hydrolases. My research includes studying basic dynamics, denaturation processes, free energy, binding interactions, and networks. I am proficient in Python and have a good knowledge of Julia, although I don't use it as much. Additionally, I am a baseball fan, interested in baseball analytics, and a member of the AI SABR committee.



Here are some quick facts about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on molecular dynamics of enzymes,python,  machine learning and data science 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning,julia, data science and molecular dynamics
- 💬 Ask me about enzymes and math
- ⚡ Fun facts: I am an amateur runner (5km and 10 Km) , baseball fun (Tiburones de La Guaira🦈 and Pittsburg Pirates 🏴‍☠️) and I like to draw
