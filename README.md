# Hi, I'm Eduardo 👋

I'm a Python-focused developer with a strong scientific background, interested in building **clean, reproducible, data-driven projects**.

---

## 🚀 Current Projects (Industry-focused)

### 💊 Excipients & Formulation Intelligence (ongoing)
I'm currently working on projects focused on **pharmaceutical excipients**, combining **data analysis + cheminformatics + ML** to support formulation decisions.

**Key directions:**
- Building structured datasets of excipients (properties, roles, compatibility signals)
- Feature engineering from molecular descriptors (RDKit-style)
- Predictive models for formulation-relevant outcomes (classification/regression)
- Reproducible pipelines for cleaning, validation, and reporting

**Stack:**
Python · pandas · scikit-learn · Jupyter · RDKit · Git · Linux

---

## 📌 Featured Repositories
⭐ *(Pin 4–6 repos here on GitHub so recruiters see them first)*  
- `project_1` — short description  
- `project_2` — short description  
- `project_3` — short description  

---

## 🧰 Skills
- **Programming:** Python, Bash, Git
- **Data:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **ML:** scikit-learn (baseline models, evaluation)
- **Scientific computing:** simulations, numerical analysis
- **Workflow:** reproducibility, automation (CI/CD in progress)

---

## 🎯 What I'm improving right now
- Writing more tests (pytest)
- Better project structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml`)
- Documentation and examples for every repo

 ### :man_technologist: About Me :

I studied Physics and earned an M.Sc. and PhD in Theoretical Chemistry from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp, Campinas-SP, Brazil). My Ph.D. was focused on molecular dynamics simulations of enzymes, specifically Glycosyl Hydrolases. My research includes studying basic dynamics, denaturation processes, free energy, binding interactions, and networks. I am proficient in Python and have a good knowledge of Julia, although I don't use it as much. Additionally, I am a baseball fan, interested in baseball analytic.



Here are some quick facts about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on molecular dynamics of enzymes,python,  machine learning and data science 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning,julia, data science and molecular dynamics
- 💬 Ask me about enzymes and math
- ⚡ Fun facts: I am an amateur runner (5km and 10 Km) , baseball fun (Tiburones de La Guaira🦈 and Pittsburg Pirates 🏴‍☠️) and I like to draw
