### :man_technologist: About Me :

I studied Physics and earned an M.Sc. and PhD in Theoretical Chemistry from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp, Campinas-SP, Brazil). My Ph.D. was focused on molecular dynamics simulations of enzymes, specifically Glycosyl Hydrolases. My research includes studying basic dynamics, denaturation processes, free energy, binding interactions, and networks. I am proficient in Python and have a good knowledge of Julia, although I don't use it as much. Additionally, I am a baseball fan, interested in baseball analytic.



Here are some quick facts about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on molecular dynamics of enzymes,python,  machine learning and data science 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning,julia, data science and molecular dynamics
- 💬 Ask me about enzymes and math
- ⚡ Fun facts: I am an amateur runner (5km and 10 Km) , baseball fun (Tiburones de La Guaira🦈 and Pittsburg Pirates 🏴‍☠️) and I like to draw
